I will use GitHub to house my personal projects to display to future employers my ability to code. I would include pictures, gifs, and GitHub has their own Readme file that displays on the main git page. It is an awesome tool, that has version control features that allow my portfolio to be up to date, and to be easily viewable by others (including employers). All in all, it's an awesome website to house your coding projects, and to showcase them aswell.
