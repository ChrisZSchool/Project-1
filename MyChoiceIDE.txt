My IDE of choice for this semester will be VScode by Microsoft. VSCode has many lovely extensions that I simply just cannot code without, such as Prettify, GitHub Helpers, Debug Tools, UI Skins, and coding utilities. It also has Microsoft's famous intellisense, and other IDES or code interpreters versions of it just doesn't compare. I also find that VSCode is less resource intensive then other IDES or code interpreters, so that is a huge plus in terms of laptop battery life and performance.
